# Project Title

The Streamlit app is configured with a title, icon, layout, and sidebar state, featuring tabs for "Series List," "ICC Rankings," and "ICC Records." 

In the Series List Tab, users can select the type of series (international, league, domestic, women) from a sidebar and view the corresponding series data in a DataFrame.

The ICC Rankings Tab allows users to choose the format type (test, odi, t20), gender (men/women), and ranking category (batsmen, bowlers, allrounders, teams) via the sidebar, and displays the ICC ranking data in a DataFrame. 

The ICC Records Tab presents ICC records data, such as all-time most runs in test cricket, in a DataFrame and handles the retrieval and formatting of this data for display.
